"""
enforcer.py — Pre-flight enforcement of Mneme decisions against a prompt.

Checks an input text against retrieved decisions and returns a structured
result with PASS / WARN / FAIL verdict and per-violation details.

Severity semantics:
    FAIL  — input contains a term from a decision's anti_patterns list.
    WARN  — input mentions a term that a "no X" constraint forbids.
    PASS  — no violations found among the top-N retrieved decisions.

Exit codes for the CLI:
    0 = PASS, 1 = WARN, 2 = FAIL
