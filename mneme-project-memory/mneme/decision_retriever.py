"""
decision_retriever.py — Score Decision records against a query.

Scoring formula (deterministic, no external libraries):

    score =
        overlap(query, decision)      * 1.0
      + overlap(query, scope)         * 2.0
      + overlap(query, constraints)   * 1.5
      + overlap(query, anti_patterns) * 1.5
      + overlap(query, rationale)     * 0.5

A ``ScoredDecision`` bundles the decision with its score and a per-field
match count so callers can show *why* a decision matched.
