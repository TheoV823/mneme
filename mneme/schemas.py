schemas.py — Core data models for Mneme project memory.

All models are plain dataclasses. No database, no ORM.
The memory store deserialises these from a JSON file at load time.

Memory item types
-----------------
fact                 A concrete, established truth about the project
                     (language, version, repo name, etc.).
rule                 A must-follow constraint — violation should be flagged
                     by the evaluator.
preference           A should-follow guideline. Not a hard error if skipped,
                     but should surface in context.
architecture_decision
                     A recorded ADR-style choice: what was decided and why.
                     Useful for preventing revisits.
anti_pattern         Something explicitly ruled out. Evaluator checks that
                     the LLM response does not suggest it.
example              A worked illustration — a snippet, a file, a pattern.
                     Injected as a concrete reference.

Priority levels
---------------
high    → surfaces first in retrieval; weight multiplier 1.5
medium  → default; weight multiplier 1.0
low     → background context; weight multiplier 0.5
