"""
setup.py — The ``mneme setup`` flow (M1.3a + M1.3b pairing).

Initializes Mneme project state in *setup mode* under the frozen M1.3
contract (docs/plans/m1-3-audit-to-setup-activation.md):

- setup NEVER enables blocking enforcement;
- setup NEVER classifies a decision as Protected that lacks typed-rule
  enforcement evidence (readiness is a pure view — see mneme.readiness);
- setup NEVER mutates application code, unrelated configuration, or existing
  memory content beyond adding the ``activation`` record;
- setup is idempotent: rerunning with no material change writes nothing;
- an ``active`` project is left untouched by setup (no silent downgrade).

All validation happens before the first write, so any pre-execution failure
leaves the repository exactly as it was.

Audit reference handling (M1.3b): when ``--audit-ref`` is supplied, the
reference is resolved against the Architecture Audit service BEFORE any
local write; resolution failures (unknown/expired/mismatched/unreachable)
abort with no mutation. The resolved baseline provenance is recorded in the
activation record, and setup completion is reported back (idempotently) so
the setup is attributable to the audit/project. Passing ``pairing=None``
skips resolution and records the reference verbatim (offline/embedded use).
