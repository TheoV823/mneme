"""
enforcer.py — Pre-flight enforcement of Mneme decisions against a prompt.

Checks an input text against the decision corpus and returns a structured
result with PASS / WARN / FAIL verdict and per-violation details.

Retrieval and enforcement answer different questions. Retrieval asks "what
context is relevant?" -- a ranking question, where a top-N cutoff is right.
Enforcement asks "is this forbidden?" -- a safety question, where ranking is
wrong, because a violation does not stop being a violation when the filename
happens to share no token with the decision's scope. See ADR-017.

Severity semantics:
    A typed FORBID_LITERAL match is a FAIL.
    FAIL  — input contains a single-term anti-pattern term, or the complete
            ordered term sequence of a multi-term anti-pattern (ADR-017
            amendment, 2026-08-24).
    WARN  — input mentions a term that a "no X" constraint forbids.
    PASS  — no violations found.

Exit codes for the CLI:
    0 = PASS, 1 = WARN, 2 = FAIL
    Path applicability UNKNOWN is an operational exit 2, not a policy verdict.
