"""
protection.py — Per-decision protection activation (M1.4 P0).

Closes the first complete product loop:

    Audit → Setup → candidate → validate → activate → canonical verify → Protected

Everything here is a thin layer over the frozen P1.2 semantics in
``mneme.enforcer``. ``assess_protection`` / ``generate_protection_report``
remain the single source of truth for Protected / Mneme-ready / Requires
modelling / Guidance; this module never reclassifies a decision and never
reports protection that the canonical assessment does not independently
observe.

Lifecycle (derived, not stored):

    candidate → validated → activated → verified

There is no persistent per-decision lifecycle state. Truth is derived from
repository evidence:

- a decision is an activation candidate iff the canonical assessment classifies
  it ``mneme_ready`` (active, protection-relevant, unprotected);
- the proposed protection is the canonical deterministic typed rule
  (``propose_literal_rule``) — no new rule language, no model involvement;
- activation is an explicit user action that installs exactly that typed rule
  into the decision record of ``project_memory.json``, which is the same
  artifact the existing enforcement path (``mneme check``, hooks) enforces;
- verification re-runs the canonical assessment against the repository from
  disk. Activation is reported verified only when that independent
  assessment observes Protected.

Core invariant:

    activation requested + no observable enforcement evidence
    = decision remains NOT Protected
