"""
setup_state.py — Mneme activation state for a project.

M1.3 activation state model (frozen contract:
docs/plans/m1-3-audit-to-setup-activation.md section 3):

    not_installed → setup → active

- ``not_installed``  No connected Mneme installation exists for the project.
- ``setup``          Mneme is initialized and may provide context, integrations
                     and non-blocking checks. Preventive enforcement has NOT
                     been activated.
- ``active``         At least one preventive protection has been explicitly
                     enabled.

This state is distinct from the Architecture Audit lifecycle
(ephemeral → saved → pilot); the two lifecycles must never collapse.

The record persists as an optional top-level ``activation`` key inside the
existing ``project_memory.json``. MemoryStore ignores unknown top-level keys
and every memory-file writer does raw read-modify-write, so adding the section
is backward and forward compatible. No parallel state file is created.

The record always carries ``enforcement: "not_enabled"`` when written by
setup. Nothing in this module can enable enforcement; ``active`` is reachable
only through an explicit future activation action, never implicitly.
